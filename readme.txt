This project is a website created for my music studio
Stranger Aeons. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
It consists of an index page, an about page, and a contact
form. It utilizes html, css, and javascript in order to create 
a responsive and interactive website.

CSS features include:
    -a navigation bar that collapses and changes orientation
    dependant on whether the user's device is mobile, a tablet
    ,or desktop. It can be opened and closed using the hamburger
    icon. (located at the top of every page) 
    -uses even and odd:nth child selector in order to provide variation between the 
    different answers located on the about page.

    -showing and hiding content on button click (when a question is clicked
    on the about page the answer is shown)
    -a contact form that validates email for correct format
