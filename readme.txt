This website was designed for my music studio Stranger Aeons. It was created for my Code Louisville 
front end development final project. It consists of an index page, an about page, and a contact form. 
It utilizes html, css, and javascript in order to create a responsive and interactive website.

Media Querys:
    There are two media queries utilized in the nav bar. With the default mobile-first design, 
    the navigation links are hidden until the hamburger icon is clicked. However, when viewed on 
    a tablet device (min width 768) the hamburger icon is moved to the bottom of the links using 
    flexbox. When viewed on a larger screen (min width 1025) the navigation links are displayed by default 
    to the right, and the hamburger icon is not visible. 

CSS features:
    -A navigation bar that collapses and changes orientation depending on whether the user's device 
    is mobile, a tablet, or desktop. It can be opened and closed using the hamburger icon. (located at 
    the top of every page) 



Javascript features include: 
    -A form that validates email for the correct format using a regular expression. If the user enters an
    Invalid email, an alert is displayed and the form does not submit. If the user inputs a valid email 
    address, an alert is displayed that reads some of the input values back to them. (this is located on the booking page)
    -If a button is pressed on the about page, hidden content is displayed. It can then be hidden again by pressing 
    the same button (about page) 
    -3 variables set in javascript and then displayed on the page. When the contact form is successfully 
    submited the bandData, emailData, and demoData variables are displayed back to the user (booking page).
