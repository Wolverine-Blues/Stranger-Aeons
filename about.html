    <div class="aboutcont">
        <div class="quest">
            <p>What are your rates?</p>
                <div class="ans1">Typical rates are 200$ a day. One day typically involves 8 hours of work. Rates can be negotiable. If I want to work
                    with your band I can work with any budget within reason.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="quest">Is recording to tape extra?
                <div class="ans2">Yes. Tape is not free. If you decide to use tape on your project you can expect to use one reel a day 
                at a rate of 30$ per reel</div>
        </div>
        <div class="quest">How do you decide what projects to work on?
                <div class="ans3">Friends come first, then friends of friends. Whatever time I have left is dedicated to artists I feel I 
                    will vibe with.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="quest">Can you master my recording?
                <div class="ans4"> I believe a different set of ears than the engineer's and mixer's should be used. However, I'm  
                    happy to recommend world class mastering studios. </div>
        </div>
        <div class="quest">Can you produce my recording?
                <div class="ans5"> No. I am strictly a recording/ mix engineer. I do not believe in changing an artist's sound to fit my own 
                    preconceptions</div>
        </div>
        <div class="quest">How did you come up with the name Stranger Aeons?
                <div class="ans6">Its an Entombed song.</div>
